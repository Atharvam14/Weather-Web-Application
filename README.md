# Weather-Web-Application
I have developed a weather app using Node.js and Express.js to fetch real-time weather data via API integration. Users can search for
weather conditions by city name, with results displaying temperature, humidity, and other details. Built with a responsive UI using HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.
